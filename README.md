### Version
1.2.6

### Tech

* [Ansible] - continius delivery tool

And of course MOB provision itself is open source with a [public repository] [pubrep]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

First, checkout the automation repo:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:DmitryRendov/mob-automation.git mob-automation
$ cd mob-automation/ansible
```

Dont forget to place a deployment key id_rsa_mobdeploy.pem to the mob-provision role folder 
~/mob-automation/ansible/roles/mob-provision/files

Second, you need Ansible installed globally on ansible node, by the following playbook playing:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/dev ansbile-node-configure.yml --extra-vars "env=ansible" -vv
```

Third, you should install common packages and Java 8 on MOB server:
```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/dev common.yml --extra-vars "env=mob env_type=prod" -vv
$ ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/dev java.yml --extra-vars "env=mob java_version=1.8" -vv
$ ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/dev mysql.yml --extra-vars "env=mob" -vv
```

Last step - MOB server provisioning and setup:
```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i ./inventory/dev mob-provision.yml --extra-vars "env=mob" -vv
```
